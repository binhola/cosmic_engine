# Cosmic Engine

A Python code to explore cosmology: compute Hubble expansion, distances, the age of the universe, temperature evolution, etc for different cosmological parameters (more to be added). 

For now, I explore some common cosmological models: ΛCDM (concordance model), de Sitter (matter-only), radiation-only, Milne (empty) (see my note: [Models of Universe](https://binhola.github.io/littlewolfz/M1-General-Physics/Universe/Cosmo/Models-of-universe)). (mixed models to be added)
