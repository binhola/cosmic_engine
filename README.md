# Cosmic Engine

A Python code to explore cosmology: compute Hubble expansion, distances, and the age of the universe for different cosmological parameters (more to be added). For personal learning and testing ΛCDM (concordance model), de Sitter (matter-only), radiation-only, Milne (empty) and other early universe models (see my note: [Models of Universe](https://binhola.github.io/littlewolfz/M1-General-Physics/Universe/Cosmo/Models-of-universe)).
